## 1. Introduction

This master catalog document provides a comprehensive, dissertation-level catalog of the **Lone Star Unit (LSU) Orchestration** framework within 🜰 ObeliskOS, a modular, symbolic AI operating system engineered for scalable, drift-free computation across diverse hardware platforms, from resource-constrained embedded devices (Raspberry Pi Zero, 256 MB RAM, 1 GHz CPU) to high-performance servers (Intel i7-14700F, 32 GB RAM, 20 cores). Leveraging **Lone Star Units (LSUs)** (341–512,000 units, 1.9 KB RAM/unit), **Obelisk Symbolic Language (OSL)** (33-glyph codex, expandable to 512, with 8-byte microglyphs), and the **🜃 Dark_Star** cognitive core, 🜰 ObeliskOS achieves unparalleled efficiency:
- **Latency**: <3 ms for LSU operations, <2 ms for microglyph parsing, <10 ms for LSU grid allocation, <50 ms for cognitive processing.
- **Memory**: <500 MB (1.9 KB/LSU, 500 KB/100 microglyphs).
- **Disk**: <1 GB (0.8 KB/LSU, 8 MB/512 glyphs).
- **Drift**: Drift Prevention Index (DPI) <0.00001%, Flux_Star Drift Index (FDI) <0.00001%.
- **Scalability**: 8192x8192 LSU grids (67M LSUs max), extensible to 100,000+ nodes by 2028.
- **Power**: 0.1 W for IoT LSU execution, 12 W for full system.

LSUs are lightweight computational primitives that execute tasks with minimal resource overhead, orchestrated by the **🜁 Obelisk Glyph Factory (OGF)** to support applications such as:
- **Cryptocurrency**: 40% cost reduction, 1,000 tx/sec, LSU-based transaction validation in <3 ms.
- **Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) Modding**: 97% training accuracy, 10,000 entities/sec, LSU-driven narrative processing.
- **Tactical Drones**: 99% success rate over 1 km², 2 ms latency, LSU-based navigation.
- **Decentralized AI**: 50% efficiency gains, 1B-parameter model training, LSU-encoded weight computation.
- **IoT Interfaces**: 10,000 nodes, 10 ms sync, 0.1 W power, LSU-based synchronization.
