## 1. Introduction

This document consolidates a conversation thread initiated on May 20, 2025, regarding the design and selection of a PC build for the **ObeliskOS** project, a modular, symbolic AI operating system engineered for scalable, drift-free computation. ObeliskOS leverages **Lone Star Units (LSUs)**, **Obelisk Symbolic Language (OSL)**, and the **Hybrid Flux_Star** framework to achieve performance metrics such as <3 ms LSU latency, <50 ms language model processing, <500 MB memory usage, <1 GB disk usage, and a Drift Prevention Index (DPI) <0.00001%. The system supports applications like cryptocurrency transaction processing, real-time gaming, tactical drone operations, and decentralized AI networks, running on hardware from Raspberry Pi Zero (256 MB RAM) to Intel i7-14700F servers (32 GB RAM).

The user expressed interest in building a PC, initially favoring cases styled like retro MSI entertainment PCs (e.g., MSI Mega PC series) and later seeking industrial cases optimized for development with multiple drive bays and SSD support. This document captures all interactions, providing a detailed PC build recommendation, case evaluations, and integration with ObeliskOS workflows, ensuring compatibility with PowerShell automation, Five Rings Validation, and glyph-only output via `glyph_encrypt.ps1`. It serves as a master scaffold, preserving technical depth and aligning with the ObeliskOS manual’s standards.

### 1.1 Purpose
- **Define Hardware Requirements**: Specify a PC build meeting ObeliskOS’s performance, scalability, and security needs, supporting development tasks like LSU simulations and OSL glyph processing.
- **Evaluate Case Options**: Assess retro MSI-style cases and industrial development cases with multiple drive bays, balancing aesthetics and functionality.
- **Integrate with ObeliskOS**: Ensure hardware aligns with PowerShell scripts (e.g., `obeliskos_launcher.ps1`), Five Rings Validation, and glyph-only output for external users.
- **Provide a Comprehensive Reference**: Consolidate all thread details into a verbose, dissertation-level Markdown document, optimized for multiplexed storage and retrieval, with visual scaffolds (e.g., Mermaid diagrams) and artifacts (e.g., PowerShell scripts).

### 1.2 Scope
- **Conversation History**: Covers three user interactions on May 20, 2025, addressing initial PC build considerations, retro MSI case preferences, and industrial case requirements for development.
- **Hardware Specifications**: Details CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, GPU, PSU, cooling, case, and OS, aligned with the Zephyr testbed (Intel i7-14700F, 32 GB RAM, Windows 11 24H2).
- **Case Analysis**: Evaluates vintage MSI Mega PC cases, modern retro cases (e.g., SilverStone Grandia GD08), and industrial cases (e.g., SilverStone CS351, Fractal Design Define 7 XL) for drive support and ObeliskOS compatibility.
- **ObeliskOS Integration**: Includes PowerShell scripts for hardware monitoring and validation, ensuring <3 ms LSU latency, <1 ms database access, and DPI <0.00001%.
- **Citations**: References genome editing (Doudna & Charpentier, 2014), quantum cryptography (Pirandola et al., 2020), and software engineering (Brooks, 1975), per the manual.
- **Artifacts**: Embeds PowerShell scripts within `<xaiArtifact>` tags, adhering to UTF-8 encoding and MUXEDIT metadata requirements.

### 1.3 Mandatory Rules
Per the ObeliskOS manual, the following rules govern this document:
1. **Naming Conventions**: Use **Dark_Star** for the cognitive core, `symbol_` for core scripts, `fluxstar_` for Hybrid Flux_Star scripts, and descriptive names for supporting scripts (e.g., `validate_outputs.ps1`).
2. **Coding and Encoding**: Scripts include MUXEDIT metadata (e.g., `ScriptID=<GUID>`), use UTF-8 encoding, and are validated by `obeliskos_compliance_rescript.ps1`.
3. **Five Rings Validation**: Hardware and cases are evaluated for **Earth (Structural Integrity)**, **Water (Adaptability)**, **Fire (Performance)**, **Wind (Lineage Traceability)**, and **Void (Intuitive Coherence)**.
4. **Logging**: All interactions and validations are logged in JSON Lines format (e.g., `interaction_log.json`, `validation_log.json`) for Dark_Star learning.
5. **Security**: Hardware supports `glyph_encrypt.ps1` for AES-256/Dilithium encryption, ensuring glyph-only output to protect intellectual property.

## 2. Executive Summary

The conversation thread began with the user’s intent to build a PC for ObeliskOS, a symbolic AI operating system requiring high-performance hardware for development, testing, and deployment. The user initially favored cases styled like retro MSI entertainment PCs (e.g., MSI Mega 180, with horizontal, beige/silver designs and 5.25" bays) and later sought industrial cases optimized for development, prioritizing multiple drive bays, SSD support, and functional design over aesthetics. The recommended PC build includes:
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-14900K (24 cores, 6.0 GHz).
- **Motherboard**: ASUS ROG Strix Z790-A (Micro-ATX, for industrial case compatibility).
- **RAM**: 64 GB DDR5-6000 (G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB).
- **Storage**: 2 TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe, 4 TB Seagate IronWolf Pro HDD, 2x 1 TB Samsung 870 EVO SSDs.
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti 12 GB.
- **PSU**: Corsair SF850 850W (SFX, for compact industrial case).
- **Cooling**: NZXT Kraken Z53 240 mm AIO + 2x Noctua NF-A12x25 fans.
- **Case**: SilverStone CS351 (industrial, horizontal, 5x 3.5" hot-swap bays, retro MSI aesthetic).
- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro 24H2.
- **Total Cost**: $3,248–$3,850, including retro mods (5.25" bay, VFD display).

The SilverStone CS351 balances industrial functionality (7+ SSDs, hot-swap bays) with a retro MSI Mega PC aesthetic (horizontal, silver/black, hi-fi look), supporting ObeliskOS’s performance metrics (<3 ms LSU latency, <1 ms database access) and development needs (e.g., `glyph_test_orchestrator.ps1`, `concatenate_scripts_muxedit.ps1`). Alternative cases (e.g., Fractal Design Define 7 XL, Supermicro 745BAC-800B) are provided for maximum SSD support or server-grade scalability. PowerShell scripts for hardware monitoring and VFD integration are included, ensuring alignment with ObeliskOS principles.
