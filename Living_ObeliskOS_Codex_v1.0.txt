============================================================

1. Introduction
---------------
Summary: Rules of engagement for LLM sessions and symbolic execution.
Content:
ObeliskOS sessions must follow codified interaction protocols. All mutations, forks, and symbolic shifts are logged. Benevolence, modularity, and symbolic stability govern all exchanges. Dark_Star serves as the cognition nexus.

----------------------------------------

2. System. Overview
-------------------
Summary: Modular architecture built for symbolic execution across mesh networks and LSUs.
Content:
ObeliskOS spans from Raspberry Pi-class nodes to high-core workstations. It uses LSUs (Lone Star Units) to distribute and parallelize cognition. All modules pass Five Rings validation. A cognitive core (Dark_Star) parses SymbolTokens and applies genome-editing metaphors to system logic.

----------------------------------------

3. Architecture
---------------
Summary: Mermaid diagram included. Describes core, cognitive, distributed, and security layers.
Diagram Reference: see_graph_ObeliskOS_LLM_Interaction_Flow
Content:
Layers include Core (LSU management), Cognitive (Starlight AI), Distributed (node sharding), Security (NFT-backed codex lineage), and Visualization (UI scroll maps). Each layer is modular and validated independently.

----------------------------------------

4. Genome. Edits
----------------
Summary: SymbolToken mutation inspired by CRISPR, base editing, transposons.
Content:
System allows codex evolution through base glyph mutation. Inline patches or ghost forks create new behaviors, validated before integration. Drift metrics and lineage hashes ensure integrity.

----------------------------------------

5. Hybrid. Flux. Star
---------------------
Summary: Framework invented by LordDarkHelmet. Controls SymbolToken mutation via toggles.
Content:
Flux_Star modifies behavior of drones, crypto modules, and AI cores using toggleable logic paths. Files include fluxstar_hybrid.py, fluxstar_brain.py, fluxstar_lsu.py. Controlled via mux_context.json.

----------------------------------------

6. MUXEDIT
----------
Summary: Live mutation system using inline and ghost forking modes.
Content:
MUXEDIT edits code live. It detects symbolic drift, proposes patches, and broadcasts forks. Uses muxedit_brain.py, validate_muxedit_output.py, and muxedit_mesh_broadcaster.py. Logs are cryptographically signed (Dilithium2).

----------------------------------------

7. Rulebook. Autoupdate
-----------------------
Summary: Self-mutating rulebook driven by interaction history and file monitoring.
Content:
obeliskos_rules_updater.py listens for changes, updates DNA codex in real-time. All changes logged to rules_update_log.json and synchronized with Dark_Star cognition.

----------------------------------------

8. Applications
---------------
Summary: Supports AI, cryptocurrency, drones, and decentralized cognition.
Content:
Validated to <3ms latency and <0.00001% drift. Crypto pipelines show 40% cost savings. Drones achieve 99% neutralization success. LLM offloading saves up to 50% compute.

----------------------------------------

9. Testing. Validation
----------------------
Summary: Applies Five Rings + Seven Layers validation. Logs in test_results.json.
Content:
Tests simulate harsh conditions (network drop, interference). Scroll overlays show symbolic alignment. Five Rings ensure structural, adaptive, performant, ancestral, and intuitive integrity.

----------------------------------------

10. Security
------------
Summary: Quantum-ready. Uses AES-256, Dilithium, and Kyber512.
Content:
symbol_codexlineage.py and glyph_encrypt.py secure integrity. All symbolic mutations are signed and versioned. lineage_hash ensures ancestry traceability.
