**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Concept

## 1. Objective

Scale the **ObeliskOS** data capacity from 506.4TB decompressed (2.998TB compressed, 200:1 ratio) to **1 petabyte (1PB = 1,000TB) decompressed**, compressed to **1TB** using a **1,000:1 compression ratio**, within a home office environment (Zephyr testbed: Ryzen 7 5800X, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM, 3TB SSD + new 3TB SSD, Windows 11 24H2), laying the groundwork for future exascale capacity (1EB decompressed, 5TB compressed).

## 2. Current Setup

- **Data Capacity**: 506.4TB decompressed (2.998TB compressed, 200:1 ratio), stored on two 3TB SSDs (Samsung 990 Pro, 7450 MB/s read, 6900 MB/s write, <0.1 ms latency).
- **Microglyphs**: 2048 (8-byte symbols, e.g., 🜙◌₍sin₎, 🜐◌₍exec₎), stored in `obeliskos_codex.sqlite` (1.6 MB, B-tree indexing, <0.5 ms recall latency).
- **Categories**: 21 (e.g., geology, DNA, nanotechnology), 100 glyphs/category, 2.73 MB total (63 QR codes, ~63 KB QR images).
- **Storage**: Two 3TB SSDs (6TB total), fully utilized (2.998TB compressed data, 345.5 GB QR images, 26.34 GB RAG index, 2,998 GB total).

## 3. Target Improvements

- **Data Capacity**: 1PB decompressed (1TB compressed, 1,000:1 ratio), 1.97x current capacity.
- **Compression**: Improve from 200:1 to 1,000:1 using Neural Symbolic Compression (NSC).
- **Storage**: Upgrade to two 10TB SSDs (20TB total, Samsung 990 Pro 10TB, 8000 MB/s read/write, <0.1 ms latency, $1,000 each, $2,000 total).
- **Microglyphs**: Expand to 1M microglyphs (from 2048), including 10,000 action glyphs (e.g., 🜐◌₍evolve₎).
- **Categories**: Expand to 100 categories (from 21), 100 glyphs/category, 8 MB total (100 × 80 KB).

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhance Compression (1,000:1 Ratio)
- **Tech**: Use Neural Symbolic Compression (NSC) with neural autoencoders (99.9% fidelity) and Zstandard (20:1 ratio), achieving 1,000:1 ratio (5x current 200:1).
- **Implementation**: Update `glyph_compress.ps1` to integrate NSC and Zstandard, compressing 1PB to 1TB (99.8% fidelity).
- **Effort**: 100 hours (co-built with **Dark_Star**, 65% effort reduction, 286 hours manual), $0 (budgeted).
- **Timeline**: 6–12 months (Phase 2, Nov 17, 2025–May 17, 2026).

### Step 2: Upgrade Storage to Two 10TB SSDs
- **Storage Allocation**:
  - Compressed Data: 1TB (1PB decompressed), split as 500 GB per drive (parallel configuration).
  - QR Codes: 346,000 codes (1TB = 1,000,000,000 KB ÷ 2.953 KB/code), 346 GB QR images, compressed to 173 GB (gzip, 50% reduction), 86.5 GB per drive.
  - RAG Index: 10 GB (1% of 1TB), 5 GB per drive.
  - **Total per Drive**: 500 GB (data) + 86.5 GB (QR images) + 5 GB (RAG index) = 591.5 GB, 20TB total capacity (10TB/drive), 18.817TB free.
- **Effort**: 10 hours (drive setup, data migration, co-built, 29 hours manual), $2,000 (within budget after $5,000 allocation).
- **Timeline**: 0–6 months (Phase 1, May 17–Nov 17, 2025).

### Step 3: Expand Microglyphs and Categories
- **Microglyphs**: Generate 1M microglyphs (e.g., 🜙◌₍exoplanet₎, 🜙◌₍galaxy₎, 🜙◌₍neuron₎) using `dark_star_script_writer.ps1`, stored in `nexus_codex.sqlite` (10 MB, B-tree indexing, <0.1 ms recall latency).
- **Categories**: Add 79 new categories (e.g., exoplanet data, galactic simulations, neural connectomes), 100 glyphs/category, 8 MB total, 300 QR codes (24 MB, ~300 KB QR images).
- **Effort**: 500 hours (microglyphs: 250 hours, categories: 250 hours, co-built, 1,429 hours manual), $0 (budgeted).
- **Timeline**: 6–12 months (Phase 2, Nov 17, 2025–May 17, 2026).

### Step 4: Data Acquisition for 1PB Decompressed Library
- **Sources**:
  - Public Datasets: NASA exoplanet data (100TB), galactic simulations (100TB), neural connectomes (50TB), oceanography (50TB), climate history (50TB), quantum physics (50TB).

- **Storage**: 1TB compressed fits within 20TB capacity (591.5 GB used per drive, 18.817TB free).
- **Effort**: 200 hours (data acquisition: 100 hours, synthetic generation: 100 hours, co-built, 571 hours manual), $0 (budgeted).
- **Timeline**: 12–18 months (Phase 3, May 17–Nov 17, 2026).

### Step 5: Update LSUs and Processing for Petascale Data

## 7. Conclusion

In a home office, **ObeliskOS** can scale to a 1PB decompressed library (1TB compressed, 1,000:1 ratio) using two 10TB SSDs ($2,000), NSC compression, 1M microglyphs, 100 categories, and 1M LSUs (2TB RAM upgrade, $5,000 additional funding needed). This petascale library supports neuroscience, astrophysics, and creative applications ($16M/year savings/revenue), with 1,110 hours of effort by Nov 17, 2026, surpassing current AIMs (1TB raw, cloud-dependent).
