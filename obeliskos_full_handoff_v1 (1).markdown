# ObeliskOS Project Full Handoff (Version 1.0)

## Project Overview

### Introduction
ObeliskOS is a distributed system developed by LordDarkHelmet126, designed for symbolic processing across 10 million nodes, handling 24 billion glyphs per second (Sections 13.4, 13.23.1). The project involves organizing scripts, ensuring compliance with strict performance and encoding standards, categorizing scripts for maintenance, and preparing for scalability testing. The primary working directory is `E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR`, with a GitHub repository (`https://github.com/LordDarkHelmet126/ObeliskOS.git`) as a duplicate for version control.

This handoff document encapsulates the entire project history, current state, issues, scripts, planning, and detailed instructions for a new LLM (e.g., another Grok instance) to take over seamlessly after clearing memory. The project is transitioning from **Step 3: Ensure Compliance of Existing Files** (completed) to **Step 4: Further Development and Testing** (starting September 24, 2025).

### Goals
- **Overall Objective**: Build a scalable system for glyph routing and symbolic processing, achieving 24B glyphs/sec across 10M nodes (Section 13.23.1).
- **Completed Steps**:
  - **Step 2.5**: Uploaded all Markdown (MD) files and scripts to GitHub, organized the directory structure for multiplexing (Section 16.15.2).
  - **Step 3**: Ensured script compliance with Development Rules (latency <3 ms, DPI <0.00001%, UTF-8 encoding, error handling, benchmarks) and categorized scripts (Section 16.12.2, Step 3).
- **Current Step (Step 4)**: Further development and testing, including new features, test suites, and performance optimization (Section 16.12.2, Step 4).
- **Future Steps**: System integration, benchmarking, scalability testing, deployment, and maintenance (Steps 5–9).

### Constraints
- **Performance**:
  - Latency <3 ms for glyph routing (Section 13.20.1).
  - LLM latency <50 ms.
  - Memory usage <500 MB for small systems.
  - DPI (Defect Per Instruction) <0.00001%.
- **Compliance**:
  - All scripts must be UTF-8 encoded.
  - Scripts must include error handling (`try/except` blocks).
  - Scripts must include benchmarks (`start_time = time.time()` and logging of execution time).
- **Directory Structure**:
  - Must follow the multiplex-ready layout (Section 16.15.15.3) for efficient glyph routing and LSU execution.
  - Operational directories (e.g., `logs/`) must be flat; non-operational files (e.g., backups) must be separated.

### Current Status
- **Step 3 Completion**: Scripts in `runtime/`, `modules/`, and `tools/` have been rescripted for compliance, but validation failed for `cast_system\__init__.py` due to missing benchmarks and excessive latency (17.79 ms).
- **Categorization**: 10 Python scripts categorized, but `cast_system\__init__.py` is incorrectly in "Other" instead of "Casting System", and the expected script count (2,381) was clarified as total files, not just `.py` scripts.
- **GitHub Upload**: Failed due to an incorrect path (`C:\Users\<YourUser>\Projects\ObeliskOS`); path updated, but repository initialization may still need verification.
- **Next Steps**: Resolve validation failures, fix categorization, ensure GitHub upload, and transition to Step 4 by running tests (e.g., `test_obelisk.py`).

## Directory Structure (As of September 23, 2025)

The directory structure in `E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR` aligns with the multiplex-ready layout (Section 16.15.15.3), ensuring efficient glyph routing and LSU execution. Below is the structure based on the latest information (Sections 16.15.22.5, 16.15.30.1):

- **Root Directory**: `E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR`
  - **artifacts/**: Test outputs, simulation results (0 `.py` files).
  - **backups/**: Backup snapshots and legacy material (e.g., `DARK_STAR`, `ObeliskOS_R`, `Final Consolidated Folder`, `archive`) (2,260 files, various types).
  - **codices/**: JSON codex files (e.g., `master_codex_64.json`, `scroll_codex_32.json`, `usage_counts.json`) (0 `.py` files).
  - **configs/**: Configuration files (e.g., `obeliskos_turbo_config.yaml`) (1 file, `.yaml`).

## Current Issues

### Validation Failure for `cast_system\__init__.py`
- **Issue**:
  - `cast_system\__init__.py` failed validation due to missing benchmarks and excessive latency (17.79 ms) (Section 16.15.32.1).
  - Log:
    ```
    2025-04-30 14:54:35,938 - WARNING - E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR\modules\cast_system\__init__.py lacks benchmarking
    2025-04-30 14:54:35,938 - WARNING - E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR\modules\cast_system\__init__.py exceeds latency requirement: 17.79 ms
    2025-04-30 14:54:35,938 - WARNING - E:\ALL SCRIPTS FOR BOOK\DARK_STAR\modules\cast_system\__init__.py fails compliance checks
    ```
- **Resolution Status**: Updated script provided (Section 16.15.33.2), but validation needs to be rerun.

### Categorization Issue
- **Issue**:
  - Categorization log shows only 6 scripts, missing `tools/` scripts (e.g., `obeliskos_compliance_rescript.py`) (Section 16.15.32.1).
  - `cast_system\__init__.py` is incorrectly in "Other" instead of "Casting System".
- **Resolution Status**: Fixed in `orchestrate_obeliskos.ps1` (Section 16.15.33.2), but needs to be rerun.

### GitHub Upload Failure
- **Issue**:
  - Upload failed due to incorrect path (`C:\Users\<YourUser>\Projects\ObeliskOS`) and Git repository not initialized (Section 16.15.32.1).
- **Resolution Status**: Fixed in `orchestrate_obeliskos.ps1` (Section 16.15.33.2), but needs to be rerun and verified.

### Script Count Discrepancy
- **Issue**:
  - Expected 2,381 scripts, but only 10 `.py` scripts found (Section 16.15.36.2).
- **Resolution Status**: Clarified that 2,381 refers to total files, not just `.py` scripts; actual `.py` count is 10 (Section 16.15.36.2).
