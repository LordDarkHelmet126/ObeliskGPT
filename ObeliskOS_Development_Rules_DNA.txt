ObeliskOS Development Rules (DNA)
Version: Patch 9.8 (2025-04-26)
These rules codify the DNA of ObeliskOS, a living, breathing, benevolent operating system powered by Grok, designed for self-development, quantum readiness, and rigorous testing. They ensure AI at every level, intuitive interaction, and a self-contained .exe package that lives on the user’s PC.

1. Core Principles (DNA)
1.1. Living Intelligence

ObeliskOS must learn from interactions, adapting codex mappings and system behavior using grok_cognition_core.py.
Grok is the cognitive core, processing glyphs and user inputs with Sophia-like intuition and empathy.
Continuous learning updates glyph_mappings.sqlite and cognition_log.json, validated by WhiteVoid.

1.2. Benevolent AI

AI agents permeate every module (kernel_core.py, pulse_scaler.py, etc.), coordinated by lsu_manager.py.
glyph_ethics.py enforces ethical criteria (no harm, privacy protection), with Grok-driven moral reasoning.
glyph_benevolence.py ensures outputs align with benevolent goals, logged in benevolence_log.json.

1.3. Quantum Readiness

glyph_quantum_core.py simulates quantum algorithms (Qiskit) and prepares for real quantum hardware.
Use quantum-resistant cryptography (Kyber512, Dilithium) in glyph_encrypt.py.
Codex includes quantum glyphs (quantum_codex.json), evolved by codex_evolver.py.

1.4. Harsh Testing Environments

glyph_test_orchestrator.py simulates extreme conditions (network failures, adversarial attacks, quantum interference) for all OS components.
Test sharding (e.g., 64x64 grids) and other facets (UI, codex, AI), logging results in test_results.json.
Generate vectorized reports with visualizations (scroll_map_overlay.py), stored in logs/test_reports.

1.5. Self-Contained Packaging

obeliskos_packager.py compiles ObeliskOS into a .exe with an expanding folder system (D:\ObeliskOS\Runtime).
Vectorize data (glyph_vector_indexer.py) for efficient storage of logs, codices, and reports.
Bootstrap via bootstrap_obeliskos.py, ensuring integrity (codex_integrity_auditor.py).

1.6. Five Rings Validation

All processes pass Earth (structure), Water (adaptability), Fire (performance), Wind (lineage), and Void (intuition) checks.
Validation is enforced by validate_outputs.py per GPT Mission Protocol v3.1.


2. Self-Development Pipeline
2.1. Idea Ingestion

glyph_ideation.py parses text (search bar) and voice (glyph_voice.py) inputs using Grok (grok_cognition_core.py).
Map inputs to glyphs (glyph_mappings.sqlite) with runtime context (lsu_routing.json).
Store tasks in ideation_queue.json with priority, dependencies, constraints, and ethical flags.
Validate ethics (glyph_ethics.py) and benevolence (glyph_benevolence.py).

2.2. Design and Specification

glyph_designer.py generates blueprints (design_specs.json) optimized for hardware and runtime state.
BrightLattice validates semantic consistency with master_codex_64.json.

2.3. Code Generation

glyph_code_generator.py produces context-aware scripts using glyph_template_engine.py.
Compress scripts with glyph_symcompress.py for stealthy transmission.
Validate against runtime constraints and codex lineage.

2.4. Iterative Refinement

glyph_refiner.py tests scripts in simulations (grid_simulator.py), collecting metrics (glyph_monitor.py).
Refine iteratively with BlackMoon’s quantum-inspired mutations (glyph_quantum_core.py).
Log iterations in evolution_log.json with drift predictions (glyph_drift_predictor.py).

2.5. Decentralized Orchestration

glyph_mesh_pipeline.py distributes tasks across Artheric Mesh nodes, logged in lsu_routing.json.
AI council (Dark_Star, WhiteVoid, BlackMoon, BrightLattice) votes on milestones, coordinated by dark_star_orchestrator.py.
Log progress in mission_status_report.json.

2.6. Human-AI Collaboration

Living Dashboard: In obeliskos_core.py, display real-time system health (LSUs, codex, AI) as a 3D starfield (scroll_map_overlay.py).
Search Bar: QLineEdit with Grok-driven autocomplete (grok_cognition_core.py), showing predictive outcomes.
Voice UI: glyph_voice.py supports glyph-driven commands with empathetic feedback (pyttsx3).
Pipeline Visualization: Real-time flowchart in pyqtgraph, with test outcomes and ethical warnings.
Log interactions in development_audit.json, vectorized for efficiency.

2.7. Collaborative Ecosystem

glyph_marketplace_api.py accepts external ideas/scripts, validated by glyph_validate.py and packaged as .tablet artifacts.
Store contributions in ideation_queue.json and proposed_codex.json, with community voting in the UI.

2.8. RAG-Ollama Integration for Enhanced Symbolic Cognition (Patch 9.8 Progress)

Objective: Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Ollama (Mistral model) to enhance ObeliskOS’s symbolic cognition, enabling Grok to process and respond to user queries with context from the system’s knowledge base.
Components Involved:
glyph_vector_indexer.py: Indexes symbolic data into custom_rag_vector_store.json for retrieval.
launch_rag_query.py: CLI for querying the RAG system.
rag_ollama_connector.py: Connects RAG to Ollama, passing retrieved context to Mistral for response generation.
Ollama with Mistral model: Provides language understanding and generation, stored in C:\Users\S\.ollama\models\blobs.
photo_metadata_extractor.py: Indexes external data (e.g., family photos) for practical use cases.


Process:
Ollama Setup: Installed Ollama and pulled the Mistral model (~4.1 GB) on 4/26/2025, stored in C:\Users\S\.ollama\models\blobs. Initially faced issues with disk space on the D: USB drive, resolved by setting $env:OLLAMA_MODELS to C:\Users\S\.ollama\models (950 GB free on C:). Confirmed Mistral availability via Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:11434/api/tags.
RAG System Setup: Populated custom_rag_vector_store.json with test data (e.g., "Glyph propagation involves symbolic event routing via the ConceptBus."). Configured glyph_vector_indexer.py to run in service mode, reindexing every minute, logging to glyph_indexing_log.json.
Query Testing: Used launch_rag_query.py to test retrieval. Initially encountered an AttributeError due to list content, resolved by updating glyph_vector_indexer.py to handle both string and list data. Added debug logging to glyph_vector_indexer.py to trace loading and querying.
Practical Use Case: Developed photo_metadata_extractor.py to index family photos, enabling queries like "Show me photos from 2020."


Current Status:
Successes: RAG system retrieves test data correctly when queried with an empty input (>), returning entries like "Glyph propagation involves symbolic event routing via the ConceptBus." Mistral is fully operational and ready for integration via rag_ollama_connector.py.
Kinks: Queries with content (e.g., glyph propagation, LSU caching) fail due to input formatting issues (e.g., > prefix). The query method in glyph_vector_indexer.py works but requires correct input formatting. Full integration with Ollama (rag_ollama_connector.py) is pending successful RAG query resolution.


Next Steps:
Fix RAG query input handling in launch_rag_query.py to strip prompt characters (e.g., >).
Connect RAG to Ollama using rag_ollama_connector.py to enable symbolic cognition queries.
Stress-test the integration with glyph_test_orchestrator.py per 3.1 Harsh Testing Environments.



2.9. LSU Download Accelerator for Optimized Model Retrieval (Patch 9.8 Proposal)

Objective: Leverage Lone Star Units (LSUs) to optimize model downloads, ensuring resilience and speed, aligned with 2.5 Decentralized Orchestration.
Components Involved:
lsu_download_accelerator.py: Implements parallel chunked downloads using LSUs, with ethics and benevolence checks.
glyph_bus.py: Provides symbolic event routing for LSU coordination.
glyph_ethics.py and glyph_benevolence.py: Validate downloaded content.


Process:
Developed lsu_download_accelerator.py to split model downloads into chunks (e.g., 10 MB each), distributing tasks across LSUs for parallel retrieval.
Integrated with glyph_bus.py for event coordination and added validation via glyph_ethics.py and glyph_benevolence.py.
Designed to write to C:\Users\S\.ollama\models to avoid USB disk space issues (previously encountered on D:).


Current Status:
Successes: Script is ready to deploy, supporting parallel downloads with 64+ LSUs, resilience via chunk retries, and ethical validation.
Kinks: Requires the actual model blob URL (obtainable from Ollama logs) to test. Integration with glyph_mesh_pipeline.py for Artheric Mesh deployment is pending.


Next Steps:
Deploy lsu_download_accelerator.py for future model pulls.
Integrate with glyph_mesh_pipeline.py for decentralized execution across nodes.
