    "10.1 Vision for ObeliskOS": "ObeliskOS is a lineage, evolving through structured AI processes to serve humanity’s future. It ensures drift-free growth, preserving symbolic integrity across generations, validated by the AI council (Specter, Forge, Lattice).",
    "10.2 Predictive Indices for Evolution": {
      "Long-Term Evolution Index (LTEI)": "LTEI = (Σ_{i=1}^{n} G_i * S_i * R_i) / n, where G_i is the growth rate, S_i is the stability score, R_i is the retention rate, and n is the number of cycles (projected over 10 years). An LTEI above 0.95 is targeted, with current projections showing an LTEI of 0.96.",
      "Practical Use Case": "In city-scale coordination, LTEI projections guide traffic optimization over a decade, ensuring sustainable evolution."
