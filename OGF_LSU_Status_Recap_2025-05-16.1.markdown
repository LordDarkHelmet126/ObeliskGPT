# Unnamed System (OGF) Final and Current LSU Status Recap

## 1. Overview

**Lone Star Units (LSUs)** are the stellar primitives of the **Obelisk GlyphForge (OGF)**, powering the **unnamed open-world system** within **ObeliskOS Evolution 1** (Version 2.8). Inspired by cellular automata (Wolfram, 2002), LSUs are lightweight computational units (1.9 KB RAM, 0.8 KB disk, <3 ms latency, 99.9999% task success, SANDBOX_028) that execute scroll-driven tasks, scaling from compact hosts (Raspberry Pi Zero, 256 MB RAM) to enterprise grids (67M LSUs, 8192x8192, SANDBOX_029). This recap outlines the **current status** (May 16, 2025, conceptual) and **final vision** (Q2 2027, Phase 4), emphasizing LSUs’ role in tokenization, visualization, inference, and scroll execution for the DNA-seeded, SWG-based open-world simulator.

## 2. Current Status (May 16, 2025)

- **LSU Design**: Conceptual, defined as 32-bit RISC-like units (1.9 KB state vector, 256-byte instruction buffer), planned for tokenization (~100M glyphs/sec, SANDBOX_029), visualization (60 FPS, `ui_server.ps1`), and inference (<50 ms, `ogf_llm_core.ps1`). Not implemented (~4 weeks, ~$20,000, `lsu_manager.ps1`).
- **Count**: Planned for 5,000 LSUs in Phase 1 (MVP, September 2025), consuming ~9.5 MB RAM (~500 MB total with transformer, Zephyr testbed: 16 GB RAM, RTX 3060, ~10 TFLOPS).
- **Tasks**:
  - **Tokenization**: Process glyph-English pairs (~100 GB dataset, Lua, Python, **Secret History**, **Dead Sea Scrolls**, `ogf_dual_stream_tokenizer.py`, 98.9% success rate planned).
  - **Visualization**: Render 2D D3.js graphs (`ogf_tokenizer_dashboard.html`, `ogf_viz_data_processor.rs`, #FFD700 diamonds for Lua, #8B0000 triangles for Mongol, `glyph_visual_meta.json`).
  - **Inference**: Support transformer inference (<50 ms planned, 50M–100M parameters).
- **Integration in Unnamed System**: LSUs planned to execute scroll-driven missions (`scroll_dispatcher.lua`) in SWG grids (e.g., grid 5x2: 🜁 trade quest), with logs (`fusion_scroll_log.json`) feeding LLM training (~2% coherence improvement per 1,000 logs).
- **Orchestration**: Planned for **Blue Star Nexus** (`bluestar_nexus.ps1`, 99.9999983% accuracy, SANDBOX_029), not implemented (~1 week, ~$5000).
- **Challenges**: LSU implementation (~4 weeks) and dataset preprocessing (~1.7 hours on SanDisk Pro-G40 SSD, ~$300) are pending, delaying MVP. Zephyr’s 16 GB RAM limits concurrent tasks (36-hour recap hardware focus, May 13–15, 2025).

## 3. Final Vision (Q2 2027, Phase 4)

- **LSU Design**: Fully implemented as computational stars, each with:
  - **Instruction Set**: 32-bit RISC-like, optimized for symbolic processing (glyphs: 🜁, 🜃, `glyph_mappings.sqlite`).
  - **State Vector**: 1.9 KB (task data, metadata, 256-byte instruction buffer), enabling <3 ms latency (99.9999% task success).
  - **Execution Model**: Event-driven, asynchronous I/O via `lsu_manager.ps1`, supporting 100M glyphs/sec (SANDBOX_029).
- **Count**: Scaled to 67M LSUs (8192x8192 grids, ~127 GB RAM, ~53 GB disk), deployed across compact hosts (Raspberry Pi Zero, ~500 LSUs) to enterprise grids (100,000+ nodes, 99.999% reliability, `obeliskos_multinode_expander_v2.ps1`).
- **Tasks**:
  - **Tokenization**: Process 1 TB dataset (~700 GB programming, ~300 GB cultural) with <250 μs latency, supporting Lua, Python, Go, Java, SQL, Ruby, and human languages (Mongolian, Nabataean, Hebrew, `ogf_dual_stream_tokenizer.py`, 99.96% success rate).
  - **Visualization**: Render 3D graphs (Three.js, 60 FPS), cultural maps (Mapbox GL JS, 10,000 points, 30 FPS, `scroll_map_overlay.py`), and analytics (Plotly Dash, 100 charts/sec, `ui_server.ps1`), styled by `glyph_visual_meta.json` (#4B0082 stars for Nabataean).
  - **Inference**: Execute transformer inference (<50 ms, 50M–100M parameters), supporting script generation (99.96%) and cultural simulations (98.1% coherence, `scroll_mongol_001`).
  - **OCR/QR**: Process glyph datasets (~90% OCR accuracy, `glyph_ocr_processor.py`) and QR codes (~95% decode accuracy, `glyph_qr_decoder.py`, Phase 2–3).
  - **Scroll Execution**: Execute grid-specific scrolls (`scroll_dispatcher.lua`) in SWG-based world (e.g., grid 3x6: Nabataean trade, ~100M glyphs/sec), driven by player/NPC interactions (`npc_scroll_linker.lua`).
- **Integration in Unnamed System**:
  - LSUs power scroll-driven missions in SWG grids (e.g., grid 5x2: 🜁 trade quest, grid 3x6: 🜋 drought event), with each grid as a symbolic node (`scroll_terrain_mapper.py`).
  - NPCs trigger scrolls via OGF/LLM (e.g., “Generate a 🜁 mission,” `ogf_response_server.py`), executed by LSUs, with logs (`fusion_scroll_log.json`) enhancing LLM training.
  - DS-LSUs shard logic per grid (5,000–67M, <3 ms latency), enabling multiplayer sync (`scroll_emitter.ps1`) and real-time modding (`ogf_symbolic_lua_injector.py`).
- **Orchestration**: **Blue Star Nexus** coordinates LSUs (99.9999983% accuracy), with **Hybrid Flux_Star** (`fluxstar_lsu.ps1`, 95% efficiency) adapting tasks and **Copper Star Mark** (`copperstar_mark.ps1`, AES-256, 65 μs attack rejection) securing data.
- **Performance**:
  - **Latency**: <3 ms per LSU operation, <250 μs tokenization, <1 ms visualization (1000Hz, SANDBOX_029).
  - **Scalability**: Linear efficiency (99.8%) across 5,000–67M LSUs, supporting ~22,000 users (~15,000 gaming, ~5,000 academia, ~2,000 enterprise).
  - **Reliability**: 99.999995% uptime, with 163 μs failure recovery (SANDBOX_029).
- **Conceptual Depth**: LSUs are **computational organisms**, evolving via **Hybrid Flux_Star** and guided by **Dark_Star** (SIQ=95), forming a scalable cosmos that powers the unnamed system’s scroll-driven, DNA-seeded open-world simulator, with drift prevention (DPI <0.00001%, `symbol_drift.ps1`).

## 4. Path Forward
